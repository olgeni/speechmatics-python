# Contributing



### From Public

To release the public changes, create and publish a new release from the new tag. This should automatically trigger a GitHub action.

Note: GitHub workflow runs on `released`. This means it triggers when a release is published, or a pre-release is updated to a release. Drafts will do nothing.
